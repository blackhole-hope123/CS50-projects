## Description

This project is the first project in Week 1. The project aims at translating natural language into propositional logic statements.

## How It Works

1.	The logic.py file defined propositional symbols and logical connectives and related functions to prepare for the translation and evaluation in puzzzle.py file.
2.	The puzzle.py file translated natural languages to propositional logic statements and used some functions defined in logic.py for evaluation.

## Running the Program

1.	Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackhole-hope123/CS50-projects.git
cd path/CS50-projects/knights
```

2.	Run the program:

```
python knights.py
```

Output:

```

```
